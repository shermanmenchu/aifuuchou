                            <p> Where is the corresponding DRBL client directory in the server ? How can I append the Linux kernel boot time parameters to the DRBL clients ? How can I debug in the PXE initrd when clients. 
Extended Security Maintenance. Extended Security Maintenance is a paid option through Ubuntu Advantage to get extended support and security updates for select server packages. Me, along with millions of other people, are looking for a 100% working cross-platform file-system solution. We all know that Microsoft and Apple will never release the proprietary information on NTFS, HFS, or APFS necessary for the Linux development community to develop 100% working Linux friendly drivers nor will Microsoft and Apple develop Linux friendly drivers themselves. I figure the only hope we have is if the Linux development community develops Windows and MacOS drivers Bought this thing to use as an emulation box and using Epsxe, PS1 games are flawless. But I notice my games occasionally stutter, not real bad mind you, but enough to annoy the shit out of me. Then I tried copying a couple games from my external HDD to the Shields internal storage, and suddenly, the stutter is gone and in my humble opinion these games look and play better than on a Vita or PS3. So I guess a modern external HDD isn't fast enough to stream PS1 games? But the Shield can't hello i am kinda new to Linux (been having a few security classes with Kali though) and i want to migrate everything that i currently have from Windows and ditch it completely (or as much as i can as long as it's worth it), but i have some questions and problems i'll have to solve first: i currently have one ≤500GB hdd with two primary(?) NTFS partitions (the non logical ones, can't remember the name), each with the size of ~230GB/~270GB, with Windows 10(x64) installed in the main partition I want a partition I can share between OS's on my new desktop and also share over the LAN when running Linux (I won't be trusting windows with a network share again its just a pita!). I have tried a number of different partition types . fat32 I've found can tend towards getting things corrupted (I'm so paranoid about fat32 I've changed my fstab to mount efi RO ! - which is probably not a terrible idea anyhow you have backed up your EFI partition haven't you) . is exfat any better I have 1 NTFS partition for Windows, and the rest of partitions are EXT4. I want to change all the partitions to EXT3 to be able to use them between Linux and Windows. I heard that EXT3 partitions mount on Linux as EXT4 partitions, so I think that there is no difference between using EXT3 or EXT4 on Linux. Am I right. OK, last question before I say bye to Windows and go with Ubuntu on my 2 in 1 tablet. Will my mSD formatted for use with W10 be visible and usable on Ubuntu without having to format it? There's stuff on there I need to keep. Proton, it's still a beta feature, but many people are very enthousiastic about being able to play windows games on linux, I thought I would try it. I have tekken 7 in my library (I bought it the week before I switched to linux), which is officially supported, so I installed it, ran it, and I got a black screen with gnome top bar, and a not responding computer. After pressing the reset switch, I tried other, not officially supported games, like fallout 4, Tony Hawk's pro skater HD, some visual. 
I understand permissions are an issue with NTFS, but this is a single user system (non root of course). My concern is that there is a slight chance that in the future I may want to physically connect this drive to a windows system I don't administer, maybe 5% chance. I'd be using the drive for capturing webcam images from up to four cameras, maybe HVEC streams. Thoughts. As title says. I don't know where else to ask and kind of a beginner in this area as some of the projects absolutely needs windows and i've never worked on windows this extensively (only games and simulators) So, i currently have 3 HDD, each of 1 TB, 2 of them have Ubuntu and Arch installed on each. I've read a lot of articles and few of them were telling of mounting using drvfs and some using WSL from Store. I'm just confused and dont want to mess up the partitions in those I set up a virtual Linux fileserver in hyper-v running on a windows 10 host. There were various other reasons for those choices, don't flame me on it. I'm going to attach a couple virtual drives to the file server. It would be nice to be able to play with the drives, move them to other hosts, copy them, etc. If they ever have issues maybe do data recovery. I alway consider the possibility of stuff breaking all to hell and what do you do then. So the choice of file system I have a laptop with a 250GB SSD hard drive and 8GB RAM running Windows 10. I want to partition this hard drive so it runs a dual boot of Windows 10 and Ubuntu. I also have an external 2TB hard drive which I'll be using for storage. I'll be using Ubuntu mostly but I'd like to keep Windows 10 handy while I learn Ubuntu. What is the best way to format my hard drive? How much space should I leave for each partition? Thanks! SOLVED! I decided to reinstall Windows 10 because I was having I'm single-booting Fedora 25 with an SSD as my OS drive and a pair of 8TB drives for movie storage. One 8tb drive is internal and the other is external. I'm leaving the external as NTFS so I can use it with a friend's computer, but would there be any point in reformatting the internal 8tb drive as ext4 now that I'm no longer dual-booting? I've heard that while the performance of NTFS and ext4 is comparable, Linux will better utilize an ext4 drive because the ext4 drivers are in the kernel. I asked the same question in /r/skyrimmods (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/6rp17o/running_hdt_on_linuxwine/), but the people there are not that familiar with Linux and wine so I'm trying here. gtI'm running Skyrim Legendary Edition on Arch Linux using wine(version 2.13). I'm using a 32bit winearch and installed Skyrim it from Steam. It works fine - until I try to use HDT. When I use HDT - even without any other mods - the game starts lagging. Terribly. As in, every second My 4Tb Seagate Personal Cloud that I store my media on was starting to run low on space so I took advantage of the Best Buy sale and picked up an 8Tb Easystore. When I got home I was excited to have the new drive so I immediately mounted it in one of my Ubuntu VMs, transferred my media from the Seagate to it and started adding new media. Later it dawned on me that I should have formatted the drive to ext4. I still have all my media on the Seagate and I think there is enough room left to trans. Support for the F2FS filesystem has improved with the 4.x Linux kernel series and since 4.4 just came out, I'm curious if any of you use it as your filesystem of choice for gaming off of an SSD. I ran into issues with XFS in some games that were 32 bit ( which is a known issue (https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/620695877288637183/)) and most still recommend EXT4 for SSDs and mechanical drives for compatibility. Since many benchmarks favor F2FS and since it gets better 
I hope this is okay to post here, but I was wondering if I can edit the img file before I flash to an sd card. My reason is because I only have a 64gb card and I don't want most of the files on the image. Is there a way to delete roms and videos etc. in order to make the image smaller so I can fit it on a 64gb card. I tried mounting the img with daemon tools, but it keeps saying windows does not have access So sometimes I need to grab files from my Linux partition while running Windows 10 and it's a drag to restart into Linux, mount my Windows partition, and copy the file over and restart back into Windows. On bash for Windows, lsblk doesn't display anything and fdisk -l says "cannot open /proc/partitions" Anyone have any idea on how to access an ext4 partition with the Linux subsystem. I was very surprised to find that Microsoft gives a warning. I don't recall previous versions of Windows doing the same. Ooops link: (http://i.imgur.com/bDOLT.png). </p>
