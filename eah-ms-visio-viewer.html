                            <p> So I have ventured into a area of SharePoint where as a Site Administrator/Designer/Developer, the tools I am used to are seriously lacking much like TRex arms. SPD, Visio, VS, and InfoPath seem to have read access only for most actions and all of the ways that I have been accustomed to modified and branding are blocked but they want me to build a Standards (company guideline and process) Wiki with only OOB webparts except I have present just that and they want something else. One of the request. 
Hi. I am looking forward to buy a surface pro 4 for my work. I am an electrical engineer in the building services industry. The software I will be using are: 1. Autodesk DWG TruViewer 2014 for viewing Autocad DWG drawings. There will be no autocad drafting on the surface pro 2. Bluebeam Revu for viewing PDFs and marking up PDFs. PDFs that I need to refer to could be an A4 document ranging from 50 pages to 500 pages. Drawings that I markup can go as large as 1 x A0 size drawing. 3. Filecenter. This was put into our slides for the first day. I'm currently compiling everything while I'm working on the first lab. I won't have access to MSDNAA resources (e.g. license keys) until next week when the add/drop deadline has passed. ###### Hardware (Owned) Recommends laptop with 4 cores, 8GB^+ RAM, 500GB^+ SSD, and discrete GPU (if possible) (Purchased, shipped) 2TB^+ external HDD (Owned) Two 32GB^+ USB 3.0 Flash Drive ###### OS Will need to get an ISO of every version of every platfo. So of the information that has been presented thus far I think the most interesting items have been the jpeg images that were submitted to imgur. I have done more analysis of these images than I should have and have become completely obsessed with something that could turn out to be wild goose chase - but hey that's kind of my MO. So to start, the png images that have been submitted to imgur leave me rather clueless, although I haven't looked at them much. From what I have seen, they appear.
