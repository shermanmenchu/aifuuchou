                            <p> A new study found that sexlessness is at an all time high  Here are what I believe to be some of the main reasons for it: 1.) Online Dating : Private studies (https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) and data released by OLD apps such as Tinder (https://zirby.co/blog/tinder-guide-for-men#whats-the-average-response-rate-on-tinder) and OKCupid (https://theblog.okcupid. Okay, so I've never posted about this on social media before and I spent a long time writing this. But since Yang had the courage to suggest what he did last night, I'm gonna go ahead and explain why you should at least try to have an open mind if you are opposed to the decriminalization of opiates in the United States; Decriminalization combined with the Freedom Dividend would directly save thousands of American lives. amp#x200B; Over two years ago my girlfriend/best friend died of a carfe. Last year in /r/nfl, this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6jarda/ocwhich_teams_have_fewer_fans_than_their_namesake/) was put up. For those wondering, essentially /u/TwentyThreeEightyOne went through all teams and their respective team names, and from that determined if there were more fans of that team than there were actual total of that team’s namesake. I was looking to see if this was done on /r/baseball, and I didn’t find anything, thus I created the post you are reading right. 
This topic comes up semi-regularly, and people always end up saying "hey, we talked about this before, does anyone have a link?" So I thought I'd gather up ALL the links. Probably the correct way to do it would be to go through the history of the movement chronologically, but given that the term went through a bit of memory holing, I thought it's better to go through everything more or less in the order I ran into it. I probably saw some references to Cultural Marxism before, but my first. EDIT: They fixed it! They've got PDFs for the last three years at the top of the page now. Thanks UGA! amp#x200B; I realize this is ridiculously gunnery and not important, but I'm trying really hard to avoid studying for finals and thought you guys might find it interesting. I noticed this while putting together the 2018 Employment Table (https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/bbuc6r/2018_employment_table/) data and figured I'd google around a little. amp#x200B; TL;DR- I have looked at the JET participants placement statistics and summarized the placement pattern by region and by types of contracting organization. This should give you a rough idea on where you might be placed. (See Table A and Table B below) Primary Source document: 2018 Participating Organization and Placement Number ( amp#x200B; Hello JET redditors! It is me, the desk-warming goblin. Tl;dr: Ashlander names are inspired by/directly lifted from Assyrian names. Ashlander names aren’t built from prefixes and suffixes; rather, they’re full sentences that describe how the parent felt during the child’s birth. EDIT: u/EnricoDandolo1204 pointed out that many Ashlander names are southern Akkadian and Babylonian. I'll be revising this system to be more faithful to those roots. EDIT 2: update post (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/b2hxd7/update_weve_been_underestimating_ash. I know you are all sick to death of MMT stuff, but they did just release a textbook so I'm going to talk about it. To keep this off of the BE Fiat thread, I thought I'd post here. So there is an MMT book: Macroeconomics by Mitchell, Wray, and Watts. Marketing: Textbook (https://www.macmillanihe.com/page/detail/Macroeconomics/?K=9781137610669) PDF link to table of contents, front matter, and first two chapters (https://www.macmillanihe.com/resources/sample-chapters/9781137610669_samp.

Particularly interesting to me are the works of Mitin, who was the main Soviet philosopher to overthrow Deborin, and reigned over Soviet DiaMat into the Gorby years. His philosophy was often called the "New Philosophy" in the 1930s, and was a direct influence on Ai Siqi and Mao. But there are plenty of historical and political books as well. As well as a Soviet textbook on Psychology 
As vice president, Biden sought to remake the rules of sexual culture on college campuses and beyond. He succeeded—and now is suffering for it. (https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/03/joe-biden-college-campus-sexual-assault-226481) gtJoe Biden is now living in the world of accusation he helped to create. It is one of peril for the accused, in which they are subjected to expansive definitions of sexual misconduct and little benefit of the doubt. Biden helped to bring it about. These resources explore the origin of this still widely-held belief, despite the fact that nature is not inherently balanced and is in fact in a state of constant change; better described with the metaphor of “the flux of nature”: gtThe balance of nature has been a background assumption in natural history since antiquity, but even to the present it has seldom been closely studied. The idea of a balance of nature emerged, but only implicitly, in antiquity. During the 17th century This post is divided into two sections to make it easier to follow along: 'basics', containing factual statements and general information; second is 'cult(ure)', which explains how Hillsong could fit the definition of cult, and examines Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, Hillsong's most prominent members, as a way of examining Hillsong’s influence on the pop music landscape and pop culture as a whole. This final section would probably be most interesting if you're in a rush, but it's difficult. 懂得很高深的数学，是什么感觉？ 用搜索引擎发现步行街曾转载过： (kanqiu://bbs/topic/9107631) 特别好的一篇文章，转发给那些对数学还有热爱的人们。 Quora原文：lthttps://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-understand-advanced-mathematicsgt 下面是翻译版的链接： 河蟹\ /blog/265181502/906807769 ( 河蟹 /blog/265181502/906807769) 全文如下： 【Mathematics / 数学】 What is it like to have an understanding of very advanced mathematics? 懂得很高深的数学，是什么感觉？ Anon User • You can answer. Quick Backstory: So basically, I wanted to write an essay for my school newspaper, but even after editing it, it was still to long to fit in (that's what she said). Apparently, the other kids who peer reviewed it now think I'm a terrible person, and since I don't know what else to do with it, I thought I may as well put it on Reddit: amp#x200B; Do We Still Need Feminism? For the past 100 years, feminism has made huge strides in creating an equal environment for men and women. Because. It's important to understand sexual consent because sexual activity without consent is sexual assault (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault). Before you flip out about how "everyone knows what consent is," that is absolutely not correct! Some (https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/1414/6117/4323/Consent_Survey.pdf) (in fact, many (https://globalnews.ca/news/2208421/getconsent-two-thirds-of-canadians-dont-fully-understand-sexual-consent/)) people are legit confused about what constit.
